= About =
This is a large scale terrain generator designed primarily to generate worlds for fantasy games, such as DnD. Generated maps are roughly the size of Germany when finished.

The user can experience the map at three levels, an overworld view, a regional view, and then a battle-map level view.

== Progress ==
Currently only overworld view exists, at this point elevation and oceans are properly generated.

== Requirements ==
